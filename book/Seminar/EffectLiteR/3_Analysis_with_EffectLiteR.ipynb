However, this interpretation tends to be complicated because of the several correlations and interaction effects between the covariates. \n",

Contrarily, if the sign of the conditional effect is negative, it means that the expected social phobia level is higher under CBT than under STPP. Note that g1 estimate (0.176) is the difference between the expected social phobia outcome under the two therapy groups. You can play around with the covariate values considering their means and standard deviations and see what happens with the conditional effect estimate. In short, this tool allows us to explore interaction effects: How the values of the covariates influence the effect of each therapy group on social phobia. "
