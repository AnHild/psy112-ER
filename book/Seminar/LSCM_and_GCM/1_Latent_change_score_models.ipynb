    "## Latent Change Score Models (LCSMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "LCSMs represent a powerful extension of the manifest-level change score models covered in the previous tutorial. The main difference between these two classes of models is the inclusion of **latent variables** for which we aim to estimate the change. The distinction between manifest (observed) and latent variables is crucial as it represents one of the core advantages of using structural equation modeling (SEM) in general. When estimating latent variables measured by a set of indicators (observed variables at the measurement level), we are correcting for **measurement error**. In other words, by including latent variables in our analyses, we achieve results at the \"true\" score level. Consequently, with LCSMs we can assess the change of the true score on a given construct over time. \n"

    "### 2. Working Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "`fairplayer` is a data frame that contains information from a research project targeting **bullying** in a school: The variable names consist of one letter indicating the measurement source (s: self-report, t: teacher-report), two letters indicating each construct being measured (EM: empathy, RA: relational aggression, SI: social intelligence), a number indicating the item number on the scale, and a \"t\" followed by a number indicating the measurement occasion (time-point) (for more details see https://rdrr.io/cran/stuart/man/fairplayer.html). In addition, the variables IGS (short intervention) and IGL (long intervention) represent the kind of intervention groups to which the students belonged. These variables are dummy coded with 1 representing membership and 0 representing no membership. Thus, students with a 0 in both variables belong to the control group and did not experience any intervention. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we have a data frame including 3 outcome variables (EM: empathy, RA: relational aggression, SI: social intelligence) measured by 2 different methods (self-report or teacher-report). 3 time-points (measurement occasions) for 3 different groups (1 control and 2 intervention groups). \n",
    "\n",
    "Please inspect the data frame to get familiar with the information that is included. Understanding the information in this data frame will help you to follow the modeling procedure. "
