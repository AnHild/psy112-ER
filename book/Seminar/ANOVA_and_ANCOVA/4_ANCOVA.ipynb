    "### 4. Concept of ANCOVA\n",
    "ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) is frequently referred to as a combination of ANOVA and a simple or multiple regression with non-categorical predictors. That is because the ANCOVA framework allows to investigate differences between different groups (levels of an independent variable) when controlling / partialling out / adjusting for one or more covariates that are relevant to the investigation. In other words, ANCOVA evaluates differences in a dependent variable after the effect of one or more covariates has been removed. This is very important, especially when suspecting that a covariate may influence the effect of the independent variable. Its main goal is therefore to eliminate confounds and to reduce within-group error variance, thus increasing **internal validity**. Keep in mind however that this is true when the groups to be compared do not differ significantly in their levels of the covariate. In fact this is one of the assumptions of ANCOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of analyzing pre-post design data including a treatment and a control group, ANCOVA is generally used to explore adjusted group effects. That is, ANCOVA will determine whether there is a group effect on the outcome variable regardless of the starting values (where the participants started)."

    "\n",
    "1. As outlined above, the treatment (independent variable) and the covariate to be controlled for must be independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Homogeneity of regression slopes: ANCOVA fits a regression with the covariate as a predictor of the dependent variable for the entire data set. It is expected that the slopes within each group are not significantly different, so the overall model is a good representation of this individual slopes."
