# ANOVA and ANCOVA

In our first evaluation research practical session, we will cover the basics of analyzing data gathered using various experimental designs. We will apply analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models. You should already be familiar with these methods from your Bachelor studies. We recap these basic models in order to reinforce the foundation for understanding why these models are, in many cases, not appropriate for analyzing data collected in applied experimental research. 

In general, the practical sessions will cover explanations, code examples and you will be required to complete brief exercises. We will go through the answers together.

Enjoy it!
