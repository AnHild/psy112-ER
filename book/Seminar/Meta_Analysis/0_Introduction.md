# Meta-analysis

Dear students, 

In the previous tutorial, you learned how propensity scores (probabilities of treatment assignment) can be used to match observational units with the aim of reducing confounding effects on treatment related differences. 

In this last session of the seminar, we aim to go beyond primary, single studies and we will focus on a powerful methodology to statistically summarize large amounts of findings on a given topic by providing measures of an overall effect and effect heterogeneity: **Metaanalysis**. 


Here is the outline:

* Overview
* A working example
* A first meta-analysis
* Meta-analytic methods and features

Please note that this tutorial will only cover the basic aspects of a meta-analysis. For more information please see:
