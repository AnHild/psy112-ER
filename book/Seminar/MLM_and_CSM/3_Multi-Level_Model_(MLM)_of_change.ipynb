    "## Repeated measures ANOVA with control group\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "So far we have counted on having the ideal conditions for performing ANOVA: our groups were equal in number and, more importantly, our dataset was complete. We didn't have any missing values. As you may imagine, such perfect conditions are rather rare in evaluation research, particularly in longitudinal designs because several participants drop out. \n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario brings up challenges that ANOVA-related analysis approaches can't deal with in a straightforward way. ANOVA would solve the missing values problem by removing of cases with missing values. Remember, however, that measurements re costly and a small sample reduces statistical power. You or the company/hospital/practice spent so much time testing participants and you do not want to dispose of valuable data that has been acquired. Instead, you can use an alternative to ANOVA that is able to reliably model the information that is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "MLMs are not only great because they can deal with missing values, but also because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MLMs can estimate individual differences in change via the variance of random slopes. Remember: Earlier, researchers calculated the difference score to investigate individual differences in change, but the approach is biased by **variance restriction of the difference score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* MLMs also estimate individual differences in starting values (pre-intervention scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The fixed effects will provide an estimate of the average starting value of the outcome and its change. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Interaction effects between levels (i.e., cross-level interactions) will inform us whether the change and individual differences in change depend on the group (treatment or control) and on further person specific variables like emotional intelligence in our example (variable \"EM\" in data frame). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercise, we apply the `lmer()` function that you learned last semester. We fit a model by regressing depression scores onto *time*. As the *random* part of the function, we include \"id\" to denote the observational units within which the measurements are clustered (contextual variable). "

    "`smf.mixedlm(formula=\"Dependent variable ~ fixed-effects terms\", data=data.frame, groups=data.frame[\"Level-2 indicator variable\"])`\n",

    "A. **Fixed-Effects Terms**: All overall effects and interactions, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "    `predictor 1 + predictor 2 + predictor 1 * predictor 2...`\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that these predictors can be **Level-1** or **Level-2** variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. **Random-Effects Terms**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In `statsmodels.formula.api.mixedlm()`, random effects are primarily handled through the `groups` argument, which specifies the Level-2 indicator variable. Random slopes and intercepts are not specified within the formula itself as they are in `lmer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. Only intercepts but not the slopes are random:\n",
    "\n",
    "        This is achieved by using the `groups` argument. For example, if your Level-2 indicator variable is named \"id\", you would use `groups=data.frame[\"id\"]`. This tells `mixedlm` to estimate a random intercept for each unique value in the \"id\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. Only slopes but not intercepts are random:\n",
    "\n",
    "        `statsmodels.formula.api.mixedlm` does not directly support specifying only random slopes without random intercepts in the same way that `lmer` does with `(0 + Level-1 variable | Level-2 indicator variable)`. If you need to fit a model with only random slopes and no random intercepts, you would need to implement this by manually constructing the random effects design matrix and using the `random_effects` argument of `mixedlm`, which is an advanced use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii. Both slopes and intercepts are random:\n",
    "\n",
    "        `statsmodels.formula.api.mixedlm` does not directly support the `(1 + Level-1 variable | Level-2 indicator variable)` syntax from `lmer`. Similiar to the 'only slopes' case, achieving random slopes and intercepts requires manual construction of the random effects design matrix and using the `random_effects` argument of `mixedlm`."
